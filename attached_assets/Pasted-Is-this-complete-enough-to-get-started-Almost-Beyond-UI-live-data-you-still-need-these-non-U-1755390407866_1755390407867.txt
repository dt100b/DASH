Is this complete enough to get started?

Almost. Beyond “UI + live data,” you still need these non-UI items before paper-trading:

Acceptance harness on autopilot
Rolling 365d→30d with embargo, costs on, and a per-slice PASS/FAIL artifact saved to DB.

Ablations (prove each module earns its keep)
One command that toggles {ORCSMC→logistic, signature→bars, stopping→fixed hold, impact→instant x*, BEMA+high-LR→vanilla} and prints delta-Sharpe/MaxDD.

Impact calibration job
Fit ε (bp per unit) from your slippage log weekly; persist impact_eps_bp and last_calib_date.

Risk rails enforced at execution
Daily loss cap + per-trade stop, funding-top-5% halving, vol-drift +30% halving—and all decisions logged.

Weights & versions
Train/import bias & stopping; store bias_version, stopping_version with every decision. Revert cleanly if a new model fails acceptance.

Paper-trade connector (testnet)
Marketable limits, idempotent IDs, retries/backoff, clock-skew check, kill-switch.

Monitoring
Data staleness < 26h, missing field alarms, acceptance fail, guard triggers. Simple console logs are fine to start.

Reproducibility
Seed control, run manifests (data span, config hash), and a one-click “replay last decision.”

If you’ve got those, yes—you can start paper-trading.

Is the current UI on-strategy?

Broadly yes, with a few tweaks:

Gate (ORCSMC): Good (shows % and ESS).
➕ Add: threshold 0.60 label and inertia ON badge (two-day rule) when applicable.

Bias: Gauge/value OK.
➕ Add: top-3 feature chips and training meta (BEMA α, LR: high).

Sizing/Execution: You show κ and impact—great.
➕ Add: planned step and “last calibrated: Xd”.

Stopping: You show HOLD and bounds—great.
✅ Ensure day/max (e.g., 2/7) is always visible.

Signature/JAL/LR/BEMA panels: Nice diagnostics.
🔹 JAL is optional; show it only when flag enabled.

Validation: I don’t see the four acceptance ticks (Hit, Sharpe, MaxDD, Gate-off) + slice/costs/embargo footer.
➕ Add that card back—this is your “go/no-go.”

Theme: You asked for ultra-dark monochrome. The new screenshot has teal/green accents.
➕ If you want to stick to spec, convert those accents to grayscale/opacity.
